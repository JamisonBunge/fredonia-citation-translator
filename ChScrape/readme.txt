You will notice I am attaching a requirement.txt file. This is a file that contains all the packages you need to run the code. You can install all the packages by running the following command in your terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt

That will install all the packages you need to run the code.
So, according to the feedback you provided us with, we have made the following changes:
- We are now saving the output to csv file so that you can have the chinese and translated text in the same file.
You mentioned integrating with a database, well csv will make the work lot easier when integrating with a database. You can use the cav to create a database and then use the cav to insert the data into the database. You can also use the cav to create a table in the database. You can find more information about cav here:
- We added print statements to the terminal but you have a log file which you can use to gain insight into results of the code. 
- We added a debug file that you can send us so that we can check what is going on with the code. and also add improvements based on the
 use case you would require.
 Have a look at the readme we sent before, for more instructions on how to use the code.
 - You can use this on the terminal or if you want a bit more control in the jupyter notebook. You can find the jupyter notebook in the notebook folder.
 - But i would suggest terminal unless your are comfortable with jupyter notebook.
